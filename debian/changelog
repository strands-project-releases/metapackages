ros-indigo-strands-extras (0.0.10-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Adding a strands_extras metapackage
    Currently this only contains strands_qsr_lib but since this did not feel like being part of a base system, I created this extras package which might become more populated and some of the packages from base could maybe moved here as well.
