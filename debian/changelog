ros-indigo-strands-desktop (0.0.10-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Revert "Fix morse run_depend." as it's not valid for hydro"
    This reverts commit 07af84abc91d079dfc7ee8c14ad71e36ec01879f.
  * Adding a strands_extras metapackage
    Currently this only contains strands_qsr_lib but since this did not feel like being part of a base system, I created this extras package which might become more populated and some of the packages from base could maybe moved here as well.
