* Revert "Fix morse run_depend." as it's not valid for hydro"
  This reverts commit 07af84abc91d079dfc7ee8c14ad71e36ec01879f.
* Adding a strands_extras metapackage
  Currently this only contains strands_qsr_lib but since this did not feel like being part of a base system, I created this extras package which might become more populated and some of the packages from base could maybe moved here as well.
